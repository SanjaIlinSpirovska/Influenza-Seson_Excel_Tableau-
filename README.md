# Preparing-for-Influenza-Seson_Excel_Tableau
## Motivation
The United States has an influenza season where more people than usual
suffer from the flu. Some people, particularly those in vulnerable populations, develop serious
complications and end up in the hospital. Hospitals and clinics need additional staff to
adequately treat these extra patients. The medical staffing agency provides this temporary
staff
## Objective
To help a medical staffing agency that provides temporary workers to clinics and hospitals on an as-needed basis. The analysis will help plan for influenza season, a time when additional staff are in high demand. The final results will examine trends in influenza and how they can be used to proactively plan for staffing needs across the country.![image](https://github.com/SanjaIlinSpirovska/Preparing-for-Influenza-Seson_Excel_Tableau/assets/147768448/3540e3f7-e30d-471b-abdb-fca819c71069)
